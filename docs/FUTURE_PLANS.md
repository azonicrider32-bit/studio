# ProSegment AI: Future Development Plans

> Version: 1.0
> Status: Vision & Roadmap
> Date: October 05, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the strategic vision for evolving ProSegment AI from an advanced prototype into a production-grade, feature-rich application. It details how to leverage the full power of Google's ecosystem, including Gemini for advanced AI reasoning and Firebase for a robust backend infrastructure.

## 2. Evolve from "Magic Wand" to "Semantic Wand" with Gemini

The current Magic Wand tool is effective for color-based selections, but its true potential lies in semantic understanding.

*   **The Upgrade:** The "AI-Assist" mode will be transformed. Instead of just selecting similar colors, when a user clicks on an object (e.g., a person's shirt), the tool will use a Genkit flow to ask Gemini to **"segment the entire shirt."**
*   **How We'll Do It:** We will enhance the existing `magic-wand-assisted-segmentation.ts` flow. It will be updated to interpret a small "hint" mask from the user's click, understand the object contextually, and return a pixel-perfect mask for the entire object. This moves from simple color-matching to true, AI-driven *semantic segmentation*.

## 3. Supercharge the "Nano Banana" Tool with Advanced Visual Instructions

Our core visual instruction tool can become even more powerful and precise by incorporating 3D-aware guidance.

*   **The Upgrade:** We will implement the **"Perspective Cage"** concept from our architectural blueprints. This involves overlaying a manipulatable 3D grid onto the 2D canvas. The user can align this grid to the scene's perspective before asking the AI to add or modify an object.
*   **How We'll Do It:** A new Genkit flow will be created to accept the source image and an overlay image of the perspective grid. The prompt will instruct Gemini to use the grid as an unambiguous geometric guide, ensuring generated objects have perfect perspective, scale, and placement.

## 4. Implement a Full Project System with Firebase

To be a professional tool, users must be able to save and resume their work. We will leverage Firebase to build a comprehensive project management system.

*   **The Upgrade:** We will build a complete **Project System**. All user work—including the source image, all created layers, modifiers, undo/redo history, and tool settings—will be saved as a "Project" document in **Firestore**.
*   **How We'll Do It:** Using the `docs/backend.json` schema as our guide, we will define a `Project` entity. We will create a "Projects" page for users to manage their work. All saves will use non-blocking Firestore updates to ensure the UI remains fast and responsive. This architecture also lays the groundwork for future collaboration features.

## 5. Optimize Performance with Serverless Cloud Functions

For computationally intensive tasks, we will offload the work from the user's browser to the cloud to maintain a fluid experience.

*   **The Upgrade:** Complex AI operations (like high-detail analysis or large-scale generative inpainting) will be handled by a serverless backend.
*   **How We'll Do It:** The workflow will be:
    1.  The client securely uploads the image asset to **Firebase Storage** using our `upload-asset-flow.ts`.
    2.  This upload automatically triggers a **Firebase Cloud Function**.
    3.  The server-side Cloud Function executes the demanding Genkit flow, keeping the user's browser free.
    4.  Once complete, the result is saved to Firestore, and the user's app updates in real-time.
