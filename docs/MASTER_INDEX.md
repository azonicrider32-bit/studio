## 3. Generative AI Editing Systems

This section covers the innovative AI-powered tools that allow users to perform visual edits through multimodal instructions.

*   ### [üçå The "Nano Banana" Visual AI Editing System (v2)](./NANO_BANANA_SYSTEM_V2_BLUEPRINT.md)
    *   **Summary:** The core specification for the multimodal sketch-and-prompt editing system. It details how user drawings and text are converted into structured commands for the `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` model to enable a non-destructive, layer-based workflow.
    *   **Status:** Detailed Architectural Blueprint v2.0

*   ### [üßä The "Perspective Cage" 3D Guidance System](./PERSPECTIVE_CAGE_SYSTEM.md)
    *   **Summary:** A revolutionary visual instruction system that overlays a manipulatable 3D environment (ground plane, primitive shapes) onto a 2D image. It provides unambiguous 3D context for the AI to perform perspective-correct object additions and modifications.
    *   **Status:** Architectural Blueprint v1.0

*   ### [‚öôÔ∏è The "Janus" Advanced Alignment Engine](./ADVANCED_ALIGNMENT_ENGINE.md)
    *   **Summary:** A critical computer vision pipeline that automatically corrects for geometric drift (scale, rotation, skew) in AI-generated images. It uses feature matching and homography to ensure pixel-perfect alignment between the original and generated content.
    *   **Status:** Architectural Blueprint v1.0

    *   **Status:** Detailed Architectural Specification v2.0

*   ### [üé® The Segmentation Systems Encyclopedia](./SEGMENTATION_SYSTEMS.md)
    *   **Summary:** An exhaustive reference for over 30 image segmentation methodologies, from classical algorithms (Thresholding, Canny) to advanced AI-enhanced systems (SAM2, TSP-Optimization). This document forms the theoretical foundation for our selection tools.
    *   **Status:** Comprehensive Encyclopedia v1.0

*   ### [üöÄ High-Fidelity Image Registration Analysis](./HIGH_FIDELITY_IMAGE_REGISTRATION.md)
    *   **Summary:** An in-depth analysis of the computer vision techniques required for high-accuracy geometric correction, covering sparse feature mapping, deep flow architectures, and non-linear warping. It provides the theoretical underpinnings for the "Janus" Alignment Engine.
    *   **Status:** Exhaustive Analysis v1.0

*   ### [üé¨ The Hybrid Processing Architecture for High-Performance In-Browser Applications](./HYBRID_VIDEO_PROCESSING_ARCHITECTURE.md)
    *   **Summary:** A blueprint for achieving desktop-class performance in a web application by strategically partitioning tasks. It details using Web Workers for local parallelism and offloading compute-intensive operations (like AI analysis or rendering) to the cloud.
    *   **Status:** Architectural Blueprint v1.0
