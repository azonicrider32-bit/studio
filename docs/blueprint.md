# **App Name**: ProSegment AI

## Core Features:

- Magic Wand Tool: Intelligently segments images based on color similarity, texture analysis, and neighborhood analysis. Advanced variance analysis tool is a AI powered tool that expands selections without inflating tolerance.
- Intelligent Lasso Tool: Allows manual drawing with path-following that automatically snaps to object boundaries, utilizing perpendicular bias and A* pathfinding to handle discontinuities.
- Brush Tool with Transparency Control: Users can modify or erase parts of images.
- Layer Adjustment Tools: Enables non-destructive adjustments of hue, saturation, levels, brightness, and contrast of layers to improve image appearance
- Color Analysis Tools: Analyze variance in different color spaces with precise hex value output
- AI Segmentation via TensorFlow.js: Leverages BodyPix and DeepLab AI models for automated human body and semantic segmentation, and includes models from the Segment Anything family; all controllable and configured through UI.
- Real-Time Canny Parameter Tuning: Allows live adjustment of Canny edge detection parameters for immediate visual feedback.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to evoke a sense of creativity and precision.
- Background color: Dark gray (#303030) for a modern, focused editing environment.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#03A9F4) to highlight interactive elements and call to action buttons.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a clean, neutral user interface.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for titles, suiting technical/creative contexts
- Use crisp, geometric icons in electric blue to represent editing functions.
- Employ a modular layout to accommodate various editing panels and tools.
- Implement subtle, unobtrusive transitions to provide feedback on user actions without disrupting workflow.
