// This file can be used to add type definitions for three.js and related libraries
// if they are not automatically picked up by TypeScript.

// For example:
// declare module 'three/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls' {
//   export * from 'three/src/controls/OrbitControls';
// }

// By default, modern versions of these libraries should have their own types.
// This file is here as a fallback.
